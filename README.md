# Software Art: Image
Repository for the Software Art: Image course at NYUAD

Instructor: [Pierre Depaz](mailto:pierre.depaz@nyu.edu)

Description:

Although computers only appeared a few decades ago, automation, repetition and process are
concepts that have been floating around artists’ minds for almost a century. As machines enabled us
to operate on a different scale, they escaped the domain of the purely functional and started to be
used, and understood, by artists. The result has been the emergence of code-based art, a relatively
new field in the rich tradition of arts history that today acts as an accessible new medium in the
practice of visual artists, sculptors, musicians and performers.
Software Art: Image is an introduction to the history, theory and practice of computer-aided artistic
endeavours in the field of visual arts. This class will focus on the appearance of computers as a new
tool for artists to integrate in their artistic practice, and how it shaped a specific aesthetic language
across traditional practitioners and newcomers alike. We will be elaborating and discussing
concepts and paradigms specific to computing platforms, such as system art, generative art, image
processing and motion art. Drawing on those, students will explore their own artistic practice
through the exclusive use of their computers. The course will also serve as a technical introduction
to the OpenFrameworks programming environment to create works of visual art. As such, Software
Art: Image will be an art history and critical studies course with a studio component. This
computational playground will highlight and reflect upon the broader impact of digital
technologies on our relationship to art and art-making.
Software Art: Image is a complement to Software Art: Text, a 7-week course approaching
computation from the perspective of poetry and fiction.The two courses can be taken in series or
independently.
